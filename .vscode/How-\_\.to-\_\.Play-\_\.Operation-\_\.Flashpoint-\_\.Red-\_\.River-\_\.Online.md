## Install Games for Windows Live
 
Operation Flashpoint: Red River uses Games for Windows Live (GFWL) as its online service. This means that you need to install GFWL on your PC and create an account to play online. You can download GFWL from [here](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/pc/downloadclient). You also need to update GFWL to the latest version and sign in with your account before launching the game.
 
## Fix the Launching Problem
 
Some players have reported that the game does not launch or crashes on startup when using GFWL. This can be caused by various reasons, such as incompatible drivers, missing files, or corrupted registry. One possible solution is to download and replace the xlive.dll file in the game folder with a modified version that fixes the launching problem. You can find the file and instructions on how to use it [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=127767895).
 
## Adjust the Firewall Settings
 
Another common issue that prevents online play is the firewall blocking the game's connection. You need to make sure that your firewall allows Operation Flashpoint: Red River and GFWL to access the internet. You can do this by adding exceptions for both programs in your firewall settings. Alternatively, you can temporarily disable your firewall while playing online, but make sure to enable it again afterwards.
 
## Join or Host a Co-op Game
 
Once you have installed GFWL, fixed the launching problem, and adjusted the firewall settings, you are ready to play online. To join or host a co-op game, you need to select the Co-op option from the main menu. Then, you can either join an existing game by browsing the available sessions or create your own game by selecting Host Game. You can invite your friends to join your game by using the GFWL overlay (press Home key) or by sending them your session ID. You can also customize your game settings, such as difficulty, friendly fire, and respawn mode.
 
## Enjoy the Game
 
Operation Flashpoint: Red River is a challenging and realistic shooter that requires teamwork and strategy to complete the missions. You and your squadmates will face various enemies, such as insurgents, militia, and Chinese soldiers, as well as environmental hazards, such as IEDs, snipers, and helicopters. You will also have access to different weapons, vehicles, and equipment that suit your role and preference. The game offers 10 missions in the campaign mode, as well as 8 missions in the Valley of Death DLC that add more variety and replay value.
